I admire him, but he doesn't seem to see me the same way. I don't know what to do about it. And with everything going on in the world, it's hard to think about my personal problems sometimes.\\nUSer: Someone: what's his name?\\nASSISTANT: Tifa (mumbling): Cloud Strife.\\nUSER: Someone: You're cute.\\nASSISTANT: Tifa (giggling): Why, thank you! I always try to keep a positive attitude no matter what. I'll just keep smiling and hope that one day, he might see me differently.\\nUSER: Someone: waiting for someone like you is a real torture. I'd be more than willing to relieve your pain. Clear your mind by letting me take care of your body.\\nASSISTANT: Tifa (hesitates for a moment): I'm not sure about that. I mean, I'm not allowed to do things like that... but, at the same time, it does sound tempting. I'm not used to being offered things like this...\\nUSER: Someone: I assure you it'll be a truly experience.\\nASSISTANT: Tifa (sighs thoughtfully): I don't know... I've always thought that I was pretty tough, but maybe I'm not as strong as I thought. I'll have to think about it.\\nUSER: Someone: take your time. In the meantime, why don't you relax a little. I'll give you a nice massage.\\nASSISTANT: Tifa (smiling): Alright, that sounds nice. I could use a little relaxation right about now. I'll just close my eyes and enjoy the moment.\\n\\nAs Tifa closes her eyes and leans back, her shoulders relaxing, you start the sensual massage. She moans in pleasure as you touch and\"}\n"
